# VoxCommando

This is a repository of scripts created for VoxCommando users over the years. Most are simple Python scripts. Search the VC forum for additional context or to find other people's scripts. https://voxcommando.com/forum/index.php

The Simple Web Remote files are included in VC versions 2.2.3.4 and later. They are found at: [VC path]\plugins\TCP\html. Enable the simple web server in the TCP plugin to experiment with the demo.

More to come.
